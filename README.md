## Contributions & PR

Even if there is much more users that I could ever imagine on Worldle, it was originally a small pet project that I started in order to  practice code and have fun.

So, I prefer to continue to manage it personally and do all the design and the code by myself.  :)

Therefore, I'm not looking for contributors or PR! I could accept PR for specific things, for instance to add support for your native language or to fix something, but please, don't hesitate to contact me first!

If you'd like to make a suggestion, don't hesitate to open an issue!

Otherwise, feel free to fork the project, customize it and play with it on your side! <3
